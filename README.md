## FAQ
* Can we increase legend spawning?
> Our legend spawning mechanics have changed a _lot_ over the years. We went from having ultra-rare legends, to super-common legends, to no legend spawns at all, to where we are now! We feel that over the years, we've found a legend spawning rate that benefits the playerbase and the economy. They wouldn't be very legendary if they were easy to find!
* I have an idea that can improve the overall mod. Should I put it here?
> This is the suggestions tracker for NebulaMC, not for the Pixelmon mod itself. Your ideas won't be seen by the people who really need to see them here. Instead, post them to the following link: (https://pixelmonmod.com/viewforum.php?f=146)
